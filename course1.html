Marian performed consistently in the NAAC accreditations securing high scores. The College was first accredited in 2003 with B++ (83%) and again reaccredited with an ‘A’ grade (CGPA of 3.45) in 2009. During the third cycle of accreditation, held in 2014, Marian scored a high ‘A’ grade (CGPA 3.52/4). The College was conferred with the prestigious CPE status by UGC in 2009 and it was extended in 2014 making Marian eligible for phase II financial assistance. In 2016, the institution was elevated to the status of an Autonomous College by the UGC and was ranked 84th in NIRF 2018. Marian has mentored three colleges to get successful accreditation under the PARAMARSH scheme, including a college from North East India.
